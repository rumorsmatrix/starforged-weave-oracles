# Into the Weave

> In settled domains, a network of data hubs called the Weave allow near-instantaneous communication and data-sharing between ships and outposts.

When you first connect your mind to the Weave, roll on the *Scale*, *Form* and *Shape* tables to determine how the data and structure of the network is presented to you.

Make a note of your Health, Spirit and Supply values, then set them all to 5. You are now a virtual avatar of the Weave. When you disconnect from the Weave, restore your Health, Spirit, and Supply back to these recorded values.

You are equipped, virtually, with tools, weapons and AI companions to model your real-world abilities and possessions. Use your existing Assets as written -- unless your fiction suggests otherwise!

If you should need to make a *Threshold Move* while connected to the Weave, instead you are forcibly disconnected. Restore your recorded values, then make the *Suffer Move* which corresponds to the depleted track; for example, if you had to *Face Death* in the Weave, your body must now *Endure Harm* as you endure the pain of involuntary disconnection. Make it brain-meltingly significant.

To traverse the Weave, use the *Undertake an Expedition* rules, as if you were exploring a *Precursor Vault*. The rules for exploring a Percursor Vault are in the Starforged rulebook, starting on page 362.

## Connecting
If you decide to explore the Weave network, use the *Weave Network* table to define what you find, and to help set the scene for a waypoint on your expedition. As you delve deeper, you will eventually find the *Network Core*, analagous to a Vault's Sanctum. Here you will find the purpose of the network.
